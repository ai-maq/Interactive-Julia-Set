# Interactive-Julia-Set
![Julia Set](julia-set.png)

This is a simple program that generates a Julia Set. The Julia Set is a fractal that is generated by iterating a function over a complex plane. If we define a function,
$$ f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c $$
then the Julia set $J(f_c)$ will be defined as,
$$ J(f_c):=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\mid \forall n\in\mathbb{N},\mid f^n_c(z)\mid\le 2\} $$
where, $f^n_c(z)$ is the $n$ th iteration of the function $f_c$.
